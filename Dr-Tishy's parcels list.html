    <h3><em>What we have sent to each other</em></h3>
      <p>Now who says long-distance relationship can't be romantic? Dr-Tishy have
      shown that eventough they were separated across the sea, they can still be
      just as sweet and loving. The covid-19 pandemic also caused a big delay in
      Dr-Tishy to go on a date but in the meantime they both have sent many packages
      to each other</p>
