    <h3><em>How it all begins...</em></h3>
      <p>In case you didn't know, they both knew each other through an online trivia
      song guessing game called <b>songpop 2</b>. Darren intitiated the conversation
      with <i>"You must be new here?..."</i> and it goes all the way until Chychy said
      <i>"I lost my phone number, can I have yours?"</i>. And in case you didn't know
      is their favourite song by Brett Young </p>
